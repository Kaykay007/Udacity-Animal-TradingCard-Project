			<p id="description">Prides are family units that may comprise anywhere from two to 40 lionsâ€”including up to to three or four males, a dozen or so females, and their young. All of a pride's lionesses are related, and female cubs typically stay with the group as they age. Young males eventually leave and establish their own prides by taking over a group headed by another male.

                Males defend the pride's territory, marking the area with urine, roaring menacingly to warn intruders and chasing off animals that encroach on their turf</p>
